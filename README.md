# Snake

### A pseudo functional, simple, javascript snake version

This is an attempt to rewrite the classic game snake, following functional programming principles. You can play it at [https://ptrpiero.github.io/snake/](https://ptrpiero.github.io/snake/).

Control snake with arrow keys. Game ends when snake collides with itself. To run a new game, refresh the page.

For any issue or question feel free to email me.
